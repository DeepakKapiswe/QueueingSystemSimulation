# simulationTest

Simulation of a bank where only one customer can be served at a time and with constraints that at any particular instance of time
only one customer arrives.

If employee of bank is not available i.e serving another customer then all other customers have to wait forming a queue following FIFO algorithm.

This program analyses the average wait time and max wait times a customer has to wait for their turn, along with the average and max queue lengths of customers in front of teller.
